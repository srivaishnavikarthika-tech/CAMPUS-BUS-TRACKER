# CAMPUS-BUS-TRACKER
This project implements a Smart Campus Bus Tracking and Capacity Management System using IoT and mobile technologies. A Raspberry Pi Pico W collects GPS and passenger data via IR sensors and syncs it to Firebase in real time. A Flutter app with Google Maps visualizes live bus location and seat availability.
